## DialSumm: A Real-life Scenario Dialogue Summarization Dataset



DialSumm is a large-scale summarization dataset for dialogues, consisting of 13,460 dialogues with corresponding summaries and topics.
Dialogue data for DialSumm are collected from three public dialogue corpora, namely Dailydialog (Li et al., 2017), DREAM (Sun et al., 2019) and MuTual (Cui et al., 2019), as well as an English speaking practice website. 
These datasets contain face-to-face spoken dialogues that cover a wide range of daily-life topics, including schooling, work, medication, shopping, leisure, travel.
Most conversations take place between friends, colleagues, and between service providers and customers.

This work is accepted by ACL findings 2021. The arXiv version will come soon...
